## 1.2-Description
LEVEL UP...

We start 110 years ago. The continent Halla (known as the island of Dragons) is virgin to infrastructure. This undiscovered haven in the world is untouched, and inhabited only by manner of beast and creature. Over seen by huge gigantic dragons, this island was truely a magnificent natural beauty, atleast until invaders arrived to take this island for themselves. Humans were the first to arrive, landing on the North East beach. The elves were next, landing further south of the humans. After successfully setting up small parishes and farms, more and more people arrives and slowly forced the dragons out. Within 5 years dragons ceased to be seen in Halla. Many believe that the Dragons found refuge in "The Oasis" and formed the obsidian dome that surrounds it.

25 years after the dragons had disappeared, a group of human monks and healers were travelling around the continent, looking for a place to set up their monastery. As the towns were starting to prosper and get loud, migrating out to the rocky deserts seemed like a great idea. They stumbled upon an intense cave structure a couple of days south of "The Oasis". The setup and started building a huge temple on the side of the mountain, connected to the highest point of the caves. One way up, one way down, and that's through the caves. Years go by, and one monk mapping out the caves comes across a chamber which had been sealed by molten rock and stone, a weird sight in a mountainous cave. After cracking through into the chamber, the monk finds the bones of a dragon, seemed to be hiding away from the outside world, and beneath the bones were a dozen eggs that look petrified, and almost stonelike. These are not full sized dragon eggs, they are much smaller. He collects them and brings them back to the monastery, where after caring for these eggs for 2 and a half years they hatch. To the amazement of the monks and clerics of Bondalia, humanoid creatures with the features of dragon's are hatched. Eggs sworn upon by a dying dragon have hatched into a half-breed dragon capable of walking among the likes of people. These creatures are able to asexually reproduce, and their eggs must incubate for 30 years before hatching.

All dragonborn hatched in the monastery are brought up in a strict religious setting, where they either are taught to fight, or to follow their gods through healing. Living in harmony with the human monks whom also inhabit Bondalia Monastery.

30 years later, still before your characters were born. A vast war between High Elves of Calantas and Dwarves of Vorstqala (Frost Castle in Dwarven) is taking place in the south of the Black Valley (named so because traversing in daylight is impossible due to blindness from the sun and snow). 

The elven king of Calantas "Khidell Kolvar" had agreed with the local people of Inkdon (known for being the largest manufacturers of writing ink on the continent) and Dundertun (a peaceful lumbering village) to begin excavating and mining the resources in and around the mountain Vae. Vae is one of a pair on mountain ranges that enclose the Black Valley, paired with Dari to the East.

The chief "Rurik Thorgrim" of Vorstqala (Leader and Protector of Lightning) believed that angering the old gods of the valley would provoke them to shake the earth beneath them and cut off potential foot travel between the North and South. This would mean that all in Vorstqala would perish due to them not being able to farm their own produce in the tundra weather conditions.

Fighting ensued all night, every night, for 4 weeks. On the 29th night, the Elves were ambushed from the south by Dwarven reinforcements and allies from the desert town of Trolltusk. The onslaught from the giant trolls almost caused an avalanche.

King Khidell was left with so few numbers on the 30th morning, that he retreated and pulled all remaining forces back to Calantas. His failed attempt only spurred on his greed to take natural resources for his own wealth, that he formulated and created mines through the hills and mountains in the few miles West of Calantas. Humans and human-elvish halfbreeds were "hired" to work in the mines for very little gold, and were executed if caught stealing anything they had found. These mines, still to this day, produce the vast wealth that Calantas has over the other cities on this continent.

We skip forward 15 years, and peace has ensued since the warring times between Calantas and Vorstqala. Peace that was so prominent that Khidell's aire "Rhenalyrr" had begun to setup trading routes from Calantas to Vorstqala, via Estertun.

Estertun was a stonemasonry village, with the most advanced fortress ever built. Although stunning, this fortress was built only to sell the services of the masons to other villages and towns. The few families that lived here were not fighters by any means, only laborers. Estertun would provide a prime location for the trade route to help as a stop-gap between Calantas and Vorstqala.

Rhenalyrr's first entourage of traders and caravans set off for Estertun. After 10 days of travel, the villagers of Estertun opened their gates for the fleet of caravans arriving, ready to greet and home the travellers for a couple of nights. What ensued was nothing less than an onslaught. The travellers were not the traders whom had departed Calantas, but a group of half-orc and human barbarians and fighters!

Within the hour, the only living creatures were the horses pulling the caravans, and the Bloody Maul tribe. The man who has led the assault was given the title "The Merciless" for ensuring the demise of all men, women and children who were in Estertun on that day.

Estertun ceased to exist. The inhabitants of Halla soon grew to know this fortress under it's new name: Strangefort.

## 2.2-Description
You guys have all spent a few weeks in Caerth, training with the wood elves who live here, and a few human nomads who have moved away from the citys and villages, and have sought refuge here. Amongst the inhabitants are people with many traits, and you have picked up a few new techniques from the locals.

Ben 
- Fey Touched 
  - Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
  - You learn the Misty Step spell and one 1st-level spell of your choice. The 1st-level spell must be from the Divination or Enchantment school of magic. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells' spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.

Badbog
- Charger
  -  When you use your action to Dash, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or to shove a creature. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before taking this bonus action, you either gain a +5 bonus to the attackâ€™s damage roll (if you chose to make a melee attack and hit) or push the target up to 10 feet away from you (if you chose to shove and you succeed).
- Mobile
  - You are exceptionally speedy and agile. You gain the following benefits:
    - Your speed increases by 10 feet.
    - When you use the Dash action, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement on that turn.
    - When you make a melee attack against a creature, you don't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of the turn, whether you hit or not.

Delula
- Metamagic Adept
  - You learn two Metamagic options of your choice from the sorcerer class. You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless the option says otherwise. Whenever you reach a level that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one of these Metamagic options with another one from the sorcerer class.
  - You gain 2 sorcery points to spend on Metamagic (these points are added to any sorcery points you have from another source but can be used only on Metamagic). You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.

Bo-din
- You are a dangerous foe to face while mounted. While you are mounted and aren't incapacitated, you gain the following benefits:
  - You have advantage on melee attack rolls against any unmounted creature that is smaller than your mount.
  - You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead.
  - If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

You guys meet each other down on the ground in the morning. Bo-din has been trying to train Tithen-El (Little Star) to stop jumping up and saying hello to everyone who walks by. Malakai can be seen packing up a cart in the distance with claw marks etched into the wood from Tithen-El trying to play.

As you get together and start chatting and play fighting with Tithen-El, a female Tiefling by the name of Lullaeth approaches. You have all met Lullaeth a couple of times over the last few weeks, and know her to be the personal assistant of the chief.

Lullaeth: "Bo-din, Aerlynn would like a word with you, all of you please"

Lullaeth puts her hand out in the direction of the Chief's hut, and as you pass she continues to walk towards Malakai.

## 2.3-Chief's hut
Ah, our heroes! I just wanted to thank you one more time for the help with the bear. I must say seeing a dragon-folk this far East is a huge pleasure! (grabs Ben's hand and viciously shakes)

(Aerlynn turns and looks to Bo-din)

Bo-din, I have a favor to ask of you. The high chair of Hoturn has asked for an audience with us to discuss setting up a new fishing village to the East, and as such I need to send Lullaeth in my place. I let you know this as Lullaeth has a project to help excavate the abandoned Calantisian outpost to the south. Her first trip had detected some old magical aspects that she was not able to decipher to gain entry so we were looking to send word to Calantas to get the hire of an arcane researcher. We would like you to meet them there when we hear back and arrange a meet.

(Wait for Delula to offer her magical expertise)

The current investigation efforts show only one way in and one way out. If there is a magical seal preventing entry we would assume something is being hidden inside.
